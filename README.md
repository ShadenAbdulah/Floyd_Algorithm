# Floyd Algorithm Code
This code contains the implementation of the algorithm, testing for all cases with time complexity, and also with O curve notation.

## Notes
- Cases tested at three sizes (5, 50, 100), you can change them on line 47
- You can change the color of the curve lines in lines 56-58. <a href="https://matplotlib.org/2.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html"> see here. </a>
- The time is calculated in microseconds, you can change it by replacing any (1000000) with whatever you want.
